### ✅ Next Steps

- Replace `"yourusername"` with your actual GitHub username.
- Add real screenshots where suggested.
- Include `.sql` scripts or a `Database` folder if you're sharing the DB schema.
- Create a `LICENSE` file (MIT is suggested unless you prefer another).
- Optionally, upload an `.EXE` or installer under GitHub Releases.

Would you like help generating `.sql` schema documentation, setup guide, or creating the EXE installer next?

Great! Since your system is powerful and well-structured, I’ve enhanced the GitHub README to reflect a more professional tone, deeper technical insight, and a clearer breakdown of features and strengths. This version aims to impress both developers and non-technical stakeholders, like university IT admins or potential collaborators.
